# FAQ (Sample): Borrow / Return Equipment

## Q1) Who can borrow equipment?
Any authorized user who has permission to borrow and agrees to follow the borrow/return process.

## Q2) What information must be recorded when borrowing?
- Borrower name
- Borrower ID
- Item ID
- Item condition (good / minor wear / damaged)
- Borrow date/time
- Expected return date/time (if applicable)

## Q3) What if the borrower forgets their ID?
Do not issue the item until borrower identity is confirmed. Borrower may provide an alternative valid identifier, subject to admin approval.

## Q4) What if the item ID label is missing or unreadable?
- Do not loan the item immediately.
- Admin should verify the item using an internal identifier or physical marking.
- If still unknown, tag the item for relabeling before it can be issued.

## Q5) Can someone else return the item on behalf of the borrower?
Allowed only if:
- The borrower informs admin in advance, and
- The return is verified, and
- The return record clearly states who returned it.

## Q6) What counts as “damaged”?
Examples:
- Cracks, dents, exposed wires
- Missing parts (charger, cable, accessories)
- Device not powering on / abnormal behavior
If unsure, treat as damaged and escalate for inspection.

## Q7) What happens if an item is damaged or missing?
- Create an incident record
- Inform the duty/admin point-of-contact
- Do not re-issue the item until cleared

## Q8) What is the recommended return timing?
Return on or before the agreed return time. If an extension is needed, borrower should request it early for admin approval.

## Q9) How do we reduce disputes about condition?
Always record condition at both borrowing and return:
- quick checklist
- photo (optional)
- clear remarks if defects already existed

## Q10) What if the system is down?
Use a temporary manual record (paper or spreadsheet) and backfill the data once the system is restored.
